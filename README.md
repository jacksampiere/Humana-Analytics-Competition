Every year, Humana and Texas A&M's Mays Business School team up to host a healthcare analytics case competition. As a first-year MSBA student at UCLA Anderson, I was eager to get as much hands-on experience with real-world data as possible, so I teamed up with two fellow UCLA MSBA students and entered the challenge.

This project allowed me to exercise my technical skills as I used Python to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling. I also gained valuable experience translating the insights that we were able to gather from our analysis into actionable business recommendations.

Despite analytics and machine learning being relatively new to all of us, we achieved a great deal of success in the competition, placing 3rd out of roughly 300 teams. We were fortunate enough to present our analysis, insights, and business recommendations to a panel of Humana analytics executives and Mays faculty.
